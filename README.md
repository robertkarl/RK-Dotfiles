### RK's crossplatform dotfiles repo

#### Goals
- quick setup of dotfiles on OS X and Linux.
- Source local config files if they are available. For example, machine-specific bash rules can be placed in
  `~/.bashprofile.local` and they'll be sourced.
- Avoid bashisms and don't use platform specific code unless needed.
